Code I wrote for consulting gigs. 

Clockin/Out was for an ag cooperative internship I had back in 2005. It's the first non-academic software I ever wrote. Ultimately, the code did not go live due to the poor internet connections at their field locations. It was slightly defeating, having poured so much effort into this, but I learned a lot from the project - namely, how to teach myself a new programming language, which is an invaluable skill.

ARN Networks, a small PC shop, hired me to compile Sangoma WAN drivers for IPCop Linux. IPCop is very bare-bones and meant to be a very secure appliance, so it doesn't have build tools. So I ended up installing Slackware (which is also bare-bones, but meant for desktop/server usage) with the same kernel version and compiled the drivers on there, then transferred the binaries over to the IPCop box. Then they asked me to help block some evil IP addresses from China through iptables, so I wrote them a script to automate that process.

calthatherapy was for a business website I was consulting on.

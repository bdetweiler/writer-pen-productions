<p><big><strong>1. Introduction</p></big></strong>

<a name="WhatIs"></a>
<p><big><strong>1.1 What is Clockin/Out?</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
Clockin/Out is a PHP script with a MySQL backend that is used primarily for timestamp recording.
Think of it as you would a regular time card. On both systems, times are recorded when you
press the button. On both systems, times are shown in 24-hour time with 100 minutes per hour
instead of the usual 60. Both systems have roughly an equal ammount, if not the same ammount of
weaknesses and strengths. This FAQ will go over some of those. <br><br>For those wondering:
the name Clockin/Out is a play on words. Think of it as "Clockin' Out" and "Clock In/Out".
</blockquote>

<a name="System"></a>
<p><big><strong>1.2 On what systems does Clockin/Out run?</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        While Clockin/Out runs on its own server, you can use it from any machine with a web browser on the
        Aurora Cooperative network. The script itself runs on OpenBSD, a Unix-like BSD variant. The avarage
        user needn't be concearned with this though. The important thing is, if your machine has a web
        browser (Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, etc.) you can use it.
</blockquote>

<a name="License"></a>
<p><big><strong>1.3 What licenses does Clockin/Out use?</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        Clockin/Out itself is produced under the
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.
        The GNU General Public License (GPL) in a nutshell states that, should this script be distributed or sold in any way,
        the source code must be included. Why the GPL? There are many reasons for Open Source Software,
        but the primary one in this instance because of the backend database, <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a>.
        MySQL is dually-licensed, meaning it can be used with one or the other.
        <br><br>
        In order to use it freely under the GPL, the application using it must also be licensed under the GPL.
        <br><br>
        <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> is licensed under the
        <a href="http://www.php.net/license/3_0.txt">PHP License</a>, a less restrictive
        license which states that you may distribute your software with or without source code. It is
        compatible with the GPL.
        <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a> is the worlds most popular web server which runs on a variety
        of platforms, including Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and, in this case, OpenBSD. It is freely available under the
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses">Apache License</a>. It is a GPL compatible license.
        <br><br>
        The operating system on which Clockin/Out runs is OpenBSD. It is made available under the
        <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD License</a>, and can be found at
        <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">http://www.openbsd.org</a>.
</blockquote>

<a name="WhySwitch"></a>
<p><big><strong>1.4 Why switch from manual time cards to an automated system.</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        This question has been raised by a few individuals. The answer is "efficiency." Under the current
        system, it takes days to get all the time cards in, and then our employees have to figure the times
        manually using adding machines. This is a tedious job. One that can easily be remedied with the help
        of technology.
        <br><br>
        Though this may seem like an unnecessary change to some, from a CEO's standpoint, it can save time
        and money, and in the long run, help Aurora Cooperative to continue moving forward in Agricultural
        Business.
</blockquote>

<a name="Support"></a>
<p><big><strong>1.5 Who maintains Clockin/Out?</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        The author and maintainer of Clockin/Out is Brian Detweiler.
        Brian served as an intern for Aurora Cooperative during the summer of 2004. Please send bugs or
        other problems with Clockin/Out to <a href="mailto:bdetweiler@gmail.com">bdetweiler@gmail.com</a>.
        <br><br>
        Brian is a student at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, likes programming, has a sense of humor,
        and enjoys talking in third person.

<p><big><strong>3.1 Logging in</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        When logging in for the first time, your password will be identical to your username.
        Your username is your last name followed by your first innitial. Those with identical last
        names and identical first innitials have been taken into consideration. In this case, the person
        whose first name comes alphabetically last will use the first two letters of their first name.

        When logging in for the first time, type in your username and password (both identitical), and press the
        "Submit" button. If you typed everything in correctly, you should see a page telling you that your password
        has expired. You are required to change it. Passwords must be six (6) characters in length, and may consist
        of alpha-numeric (numbers, letters, or both) characters and are CASE SENSITIVE. Keep this in mind when 
	   choosing a password. 
        <br><br>
        When you have successfully changed your password, a screen will tell you so, and will redirect you to the
        login page. You must now login with your new password. This is done to ensure you have typed your password
        correctly. If you cannot get back in, doublecheck your typing. Make sure you are typing in the correct
        case. Is caps lock on? Should it be? If all else fails, a supervisor may reset your password to
        your username and you can try again.

<a name="ClockingIn"></a>
<p><big><strong>3.2 Clocking in</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        To clock in, simply go to the <a href="http://192.168.0.41/login.php">login page</a>, enter your
        username and password, select the "Clock In" radio button, check "Double Time" if necessary, and click the
        "Submit" button.
        <br><br>
        Once you press the "Submit" button, your time is recorded on the server. You will be taken to the main
        login page where any pertinant information will be displayed to you, and you can view your work hours,
        and do various other accounting from there.
</blockquote>

<a name="WorkHours"></a>
<p><big><strong>3.3 Displaying your work hours</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        Once you are logged into the system, you may check your work hours. The display you see when logging in is
        your hours for the current pay period. If you don't see anything, then you haven't logged any hours for the
        pay period yet.
        <br><br>
        If you are clocked in and don't see anything, you must wait until you clock out to see your entry. This is
        different from the manual time cards in that on a manual card, you can see what time you clocked in at
        immediately. The reason this is different is because Clockin/Out computes your hours based on your
        clock in time and clock out time. With no clock out time, it has nothing to compute.
</blockquote>

<a name="TimeOff"></a>
<p><big><strong>3.4 Logging time off</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        To log time off, such as vacations, personal holidays, sick days, or funerals, you will need to log in. If you
        are already clocked in, you may just click the "Neither" button to login without doing anything.
        <br><br>
        Once you are in, click on the <img alt="Log Time Off" src="images/log_time_off.png"> tab. This will
             bring you to the page for logging days off. To take a single day off, you only need to enter
        the date into the "Start Date" field, select the type of hours, and select how many hours (4 hours =
        half day; 8 hours = full day). Then press the "Submit" button.
        <br><br>
        Dates must be entered in this format: YYYY-MM-DD
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: 2004-09-07, would be September 7th, 2004.
        <br><br>
        To take multiple days off, you need to enter an "End Date" in addition to a start date. This means
        you are taking a sequence of days off. For example, if you wanted to take 3 days off in a row, you
        would type the first date in the "Start Date" field, and the last day in the "End Date" field. You may
        also enter an end date for a single day. For a single day, you would enter the same date in both
        fields, however this is redundant and unnecessary.
        <br><br>
        You may log days off for the past, present, or future.
</blockquote>

<a name="MakeNote"></a>
<p><big><strong>3.5 Making a note</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        There is a feature in Clockin/Out that allows you to make a note on an existing entry.
        Why would you want to do this? There are a host of reasons. Sometimes you just need to keep
        your boss updated on things. Sometimes you need to make a specific comment about an entry, like
        where you were. If you worked at a different location, you could put that in there. You can do the
        same thing on a time card. Remember, Clockin/Out was designed to mimmick the time card system. The
        goal is to incorporate all of the same features of a standard time card system.
        <br><br>
        To make a note, click the <img alt="Make A Note" src="images/annotate.png"> tab. Select the entry you
        wish to annotate from the drop down box. Write your note in the text field, and press the "Submit"
        button. You must keep entries to 180 characters, due to database restrictions. This should be more
        than enough to leave a descriptive note about your entry.
</blockquote>


<a name="ChangePass"></a>
<p><big><strong>3.6 Changing your password</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        If you wish to change your password, you may do so by going to the <img alt="Change Password"
        src="images/changepassword.png"> tab. As stated earlier, the first time you log in, this is
        mandatory. After that, you may chose whatever password you wish. If you do choose the same
        password as your name, you will be forced to change it the next time you login. Clockin/Out does not
        allow you to have identical username/password combinations. This is obviously for security.
</blockquote>

<a name="Logout"></a>
<p><big><strong>3.7 Logging out</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        When you are finished with your session, you may either close the browser window, or click the
        <img alt="Logout" src="images/logout.png"> tab. When you click the logout tab, you will be
        redirected to the login page.
</blockquote>

<a name="ClockOut"></a>
<p><big><strong>3.8 Clocking out</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        Clocking out is virtually the same procedure as clocking in, except you select the "Clock Out" radio
        button instead of the "Clock In" one. Once you have entered your correct username and password and
        selected "Clock Out", you may press the "Submit" button. The instant you press it, you will be clocked
        out.
        <br><br>
        You are then taken to the main work hours screen and told the time when you were clocked out.
</blockquote>

<a name="Admin"></a>
<p><big><strong>4. Administrators/Supervisors</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        Throughout this text, and in Clockin/Out, the terms "Administrator" and "Supervisor" are used
        interchangeably. If you are a Supervisor, you are an administrator, and vise-versa. If you are
        a Supervisor, you are responsible for your employees. You must make sure they clock in and out on time,
        and that they are not abusing the system.
        <br><br>
        You are also responsible for fixing any mistakes in their entries. These steps will be discussed
        below.
</blockquote>

<a name="AdminLogin"></a>
<p><big><strong>4.1 Logging in</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        The admin side of Clockin/Out is different from the employee side. It uses two seperate accounts.
        Though your username will be the same, you may opt to have a different password. It is recommended that
        you do so, but is not required. The first time you login to the admin side, your password is your username.
        If your name is John Doe, your username is "doej" and your password is "doej" the first time you log in.
        (See <a href="help.html#Login">the general employee login procedure</a>).
        <br><br>
        Once you have logged in, you will be required to change your password. It can be a combination of letters
        and numbers, and must be at least 6 characters long. Why so long? Most websites, such as
        <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">MSN Hotmail</a>, <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a>, and
        others require at least 6 characters for your password. Most online banking requires 8 characters.
        6 is pretty standard.
        <br><br>
        After you change your password, you will be logged out and redirected to the employee login page. Click
        on the "Administrators click HERE" link. Login as before with your new password. You are now free to
        go about your daily business.
</blockquote>

<a name="AdminChangePass"></a>
<p><big><strong>4.2 Changing your password</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        Anytime you like, you may change your password. Click on the <img alt="Change Password"
        src="images/change_password.png"> tab to do so. You will be logged out and redirected to the employee

<p><big><strong>4.3 Displaying users' work hours</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        When you login as an administrator, assuming you have already logged in once and changed your
        password, the first thing you will see is the "Work Hours" screen. Here you may view employees'
        work hours. To do so, select the employee you wish to view from the drop down list. Employees
        are displayed by username, which is their last name and first innitial. You can jump to
        their name faster by clicking on a name in the list and typing the first letter of their last name.
        It will jump to the first person with that letter in their last name.
        <br><br>
        After you have selected them from the drop down box, you may press "Go" and it will display their
        work hours for last pay period. If you wish to view their work hours for <i>this</i> pay period, or
        for any other duration of time, select it from the drop down list above the employee's name.
        All options are self-explanatory. To display the work hours for the entire month, select "Entire Month".
        Do the same for 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 180 days, year to date, or previous year.
</blockquote>

<a name="AdminReports"></a>
<p><big><strong>4.4 Displaying reports</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        This option is available to privilaged users (if you don't see the option, you don't have privilages).
        The purpose is to show a summary of all users' total work hours for the last pay period, and the one
        before that.
        <br><br>
        If you have this option, you will see the following on the work hours page:
        <br><br>
        <b>Reports:</b><br>
	   <table border="0">
	  	<tr>
	    	   <td>

	</table>
        <br><br>
        The <i>new</i> report will display a complete employee listing of total work hours for the latest
        pay cycle. The <i>old</i> option will show the pay period before that.
	   Each monday morning paycycle, the server will automatically compile
	   the reports for downloading. The only reason to create a new report
	   would be if you made a change to an older date after the monday of a
	   new paycycle. Then, the reports would not be fresh so you would have
	   to create a new one. Keep in mind, this is taxing on the server, and
	   can take about five to six minutes. This can also hold up other users
	   from clocking in and out. Try to do this later in the day, if
	   absolutely necessary. 
	   <br><Br>
	   The <i>archive</i> section holds two years worth of pay cycle reports.
	   The reports are never removed from the server, but only two years
	   worth will be displayed. Their file names reflect their pay cycle
	   dates.

<a name="AdminAudit"></a>
<p><big><strong>4.5 Auditing an account</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        This is one of the most important features of the administrator side. You, as an administrator/supervisor,
        will need to be able to audit your employees' accounts for various reasons. For example: An employee
        forgets to clock in one day. It is your job to go in and add an entry for him or her. What if an
        employee forgets to clock <i>out</i>? You will need to correct that entry for them. The process is
        explained in detail below:
        <br><br>
        <b>Selecting users:</b><br>
        If you have selected a user to display their work hours, then you need only to click on the
        <img alt="Audit an Account" src="images/audit_an_account.png"> tab, and that employee's work hours
        will be brought up for auditing. If you have not selected an employee, you will be asked to select
        one first. You may switch to a new employee at any time.
        <br><br>
        <b>Deleting entries:</b><br>
        Why would one want to delete an entry? If someone has the power to add an entry, they sure better
        have the power to delete it. You may select multiple entries at once. Hold down the ctrl key while
        clicking, or to select multiple entries in a row, click on the first entry, hold the shift key, and
        click on the last entry. Those entries and all the entries in between will be selected. Entries marked
        with three astrisks (***) are flagged with errors. This is meant to be more helpful for the
        administrators who will need to quickly find these entries.
        <br><br>
        <b>Correcting an entry:</b><br>
        Here is the scenario: Bob clocks in late. Bob clocks out on time. Bob wants to be paid for what he
        actually worked. You are able to fix this. First, you select Bob's entry from the drop down box.
        Then, because you want to correct his clock <i>in</i> time, you enter the correct clock in time in the
        first box. This is given in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
        <br><br>
        example: 2004-09-07 08:00:00 would be September 7th, 2004, 8:00 am.
        <br><br>
        Then, because his clock <i>out</i> time is correct, you leave the box below it as-is. Press "Correct"
        and, assuming you typed everything in right, the entry will have been corrected.
        <br><br>
        Here is another scenario: Bob clocks in on time. Bob clocks forgets to clock out. Bob sees a big
               error flag warning him that he has been clocked in for more than 18 hours. To fix this, you
        would select his entry from the drop down box. Bob has an error flag, so the entry will be
        marked with three astrisks (***) to make it easier to find. Because his clock <i>in</i> time is correct,
        you leave that as-is. You would then enter the correct clock <i>out</i> time in the box below it.
        Once you have entered that, press "Correct" and you're set.
        <br><br>
        One final scenario: Bob is having a bad day. He forgot to clock in, so he clocked in as soon as he
        remembered. Bob also forgot to clock out and was left clocked in all night. How do we fix this?
        This is roughly a combination of the two previous scenarios. Select the offending entry from the
        drop down list. Enter the correct clock <i>in</i> time in the top box. Enter the correct clock
        <i>out</i> time in the box below it. Select "Remove Error Flag" to get rid of his error flag, and
        press "Correct". Now you're on your way to making Bob's day better.
        <br><br>
        If at any time you wish to remove an error flag, you may do so by selecting the entry (obviously you
        would want to select an entry with astrisks (***), because these are the flagged ones) from the
        drop down box, checking the "Remove Error Flag" checkbox, and pressing "Correct".
        <br><br>
        You may also alter their hours from "regular time" to "double time" and vise-versa, should the need
        arise.
        <br><br>
        <b>Adding an entry:</b><br>
        Adding an entry is different from correcting one, in that you are actually adding an entry from
        scratch, rather than manipulating an existing one. In this field, you will need to enter both a
        clock <i>in</i> time, and a clock <i>out</i> time. For an example of the time/date format, see
        <b>Correcting an entry</b> above. When you press "Add", your entry will be added into the database.
        Should this not be to your liking, you need only to delete it with the <b>Delete entry</b> option.
        See <b>Deleting an entry</b> for details.
        <br><br>
        <b>Entering paid time off:</b><br>
        This option was originally included to make up for the fact that employees were not allowed to
        log time off for days in the past, including the present day. This has been changed to allow
        employees to enter days in the past, present, and future; however, the administrator should
        have control over this as well. For more information on how to use this tool, see
        <a href="help.html#TimeOff">Logging time off</a> on the employee side.

<a name="AdminCommission"></a>
<p><big><strong>4.6 Entering a commission</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        Some employees work on commission. To enter a commission for an employee, simply click on the
        <img alt="Enter a Commission" src="images/enter_commission.png"> tab. Once there, select the
        employee who will be receiving the commission. Then select the date. The dates are the beginning
        of each pay cycle. You can only enter one commission for each pay cycle, so if you need to enter
        more than one, you will have to add them up before entering them. Next, enter the ammount of the
        commission in dollars in this format: $$$$.cc, where $$$$ is Dollars, and cc is cents. Example:
        1499.98 is One thousand four hundred ninety-nine dollars and ninety-eight cents. When you are satisfied
        with your entry, press "Submit" and your commission will be entered.

<p><big><strong>4.7 Resetting a user's password</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        If an employee/supervisor forgets their password, you have the ability to reset it to their username.
        Just click on the <img alt="images/resetuserpass.png"> tab. Select the name of the employee you wish
        to reset. Now choose whether to reset only the employee side of the account, only the supervisor side
        of the account, or both. Then press the "Submit" button. Their password has been reset to their username,
        and they must login and change it like they did the first time they logged in.

<a name="AdminAddUser"></a>
<p><big><strong>4.8 Adding and removing users</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        This option is only available to privilaged users. The reason for this is that if a user is
        removed, they are <i>completely</i> removed from the system. Work hours and all. Therefore this
        is not something to be taken lightly. You should make absolutely certain that you do not need this
        employee in the system anymore. To remove a user, select them from the drop down list, double and triple
        check that you have the right employee, and press "Remove User".
        <br><br>
        To add a user, you simply need to enter their username, their first name, and their last name,
        check the checkbox if you wish them to be a supervisor, and press "Add User". If you forgot to add
        them as a supervisor, you may go back and enter them in again, this time checking the check box. You
        will be given an error that this user already exists, then it will confirm that they have been entered
        into the admin database. This indicates a successful entry.

<a name="AdminViewComm"></a>
<p><big><strong>4.9 Viewing a user's commissions</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        To view a user's commissions, you need to be in the work hours menu. Click on the
        <img alt="Work Hours" src="images/work_hours.png"> tab. Select them from the drop down list.
        Select how you want to display hours, if necessary. Click "Go". Click the
        <img alt="Dollar Sign" src="images/dollarsign.png"> at the bottom of the work hours, and it will
        pop up another menu. Select the pay cycle for which you want to view the commissions. It will
        then tell you if there is a commission for this user on the pay cycle you selected.
        <br><br>
        When finished, the reports page will include all commissions for the pay cycle. The reports page
        is only for privilaged users.

<a name="AdminWho"></a>
<p><big><strong>4.10 Seeing who is currently clocked in</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        A useful tool to help diagnose problems, as well as give you the ability to determine which of
        your employees are and are not currently clocked in, is the "WHO" page. You will need to be at the
        "Work Hours" page. Click on the        <img alt="Work Hours" src="images/work_hours.png"> tab. At the bottom
        of the screen, you will see a link that says "See <u>WHO</u> is currently clocked in." Click on the
        "WHO" link, and a window will pop up telling you who is currently clocked in.
        <br><br>
        It is up to you to determine the use of this feature. If you don't know what to use it for, you don't

<a name="HowTime"></a>
<p><big><strong>5.1 How does Clockin/Out keep track of my time?</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        Clockin/Out is web-based implementation of a time card system. When you press the "Submit" button
        on the login page and clock in, the server records that exact time into a database. It uses
        time based off of server it runs on. You can not control that time.
</blockquote>

<a name="Crash"></a>
<p><big><strong>5.2 What if the server or Clockin/Out crashes?</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        Should the application crash, the server only needs to be reset. If the server crashes, rebooting
        does not work, and all the information is lost, the database is backed up nightly and taken off-site.
        It will be possible to restore the old information. Should that fail,
	   work hours will have been printed
        out on a regular basis so as to have hard copies on file.
        <br><br>
        During any down-time, times can be recorded manually on the old time
	   cards, and entered later, via the audit acount feature. 
</blockquote>

<a name="InetDown"></a>
<p><big><strong>5.3 What if my internet connection is down?</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        As stated above, you would simply record your times manually on the old time cards and enter them later.
        No big deal.
</blockquote>

<a name="Forget"></a>
<p><big><strong>5.4 What if I forget to clock in or out?</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        Your time can be entered manually by your supervisor. If your supervisor has questions about this, they
        should read the <a href="help.html#Admin">Administrator/Supervisor</a> section, particularly the section
        on <a href="help.html#AdminAudit">auditing an account</a>.

<a name="Home"></a>
<p><big><strong>5.5 Can I clock in or out from home?</p></big></strong>

</blockquote>

<a name="Dishonesty"></a>
<p><big><strong>5.6 Can another employee clock me in or out?</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        Of course. If you give them your password. This is the equivalent to asking an employee to punch
        your card after you've left for an hour. As stated above, this system contains almost all of the
        same pros/cons as the manual system.
</blockquote>

<a name="Spy"></a>
<p><big><strong>5.7 Can another employee see my hours?</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        It depends. The answer is yes, if they have your password, or if you left your account logged in
        and walked away. The answer is also yes if they are a supervisor. Otherwise, no.
</blockquote>

<a name="RememberPass"></a>
<p><big><strong>5.8 Should I let Internet Explorer/Netscape/Mozilla remember my password?</p></big></strong>
<blockquote>
        If you do, others will be able to log into your account if they have access to your computer
        (see above). It can be a convenience, or a security vulnerability. If you are a supervisor, the answer
        is no. Regular employees should use their better judgement with this one.

               MaryAnn Calta LCSW, LHMP, CMSW, M.Div, has more than fifteen years experience as a psychodynamic psychotherapist (psychotherapy) using Jungian, developmental, and other psychodynamic theories. She is trained in systems theory and dynamics, including conflict resolution. Her areas of expertise include grief work, recovery from trauma, depression, anxiety, and sexual violence, including clergy sexual abuse and misconduct. Consultation is offered to professionals in various fields.
                </p>
                <p>
She began her work in social services in 1972 in the Department of Human Services in California. Through her 39 years of journeying with others, she has become a specialist at integrating mind, body, and spirit for holistic health. Besides her credentials in clinical social work, (Certified Master Social Worker, Licensed Clinical Social Worker, and Licensed Mental Health Practitioner) she is a certified spiritual director, Reiki II practitioner, and is an ordained Presbyterian minister (M.Div).
                </p>
                <p>
Traditional “Christian” therapy is NOT used in her practice; rather, Ms. Calta draws from her extensive background of working in interfaith settings as clergy and secular clinical settings as a hospital chaplain and psychotherapist. Incorporating any spiritual issues into the therapy is done strictly at the client’s request. She welcomes people of all faith traditions.
                </p>
                <p>
Ms. Calta believes the common boundaries of spiritual and mental health intersect in our lives as we search for meaning and wholeness, regardless of faith background. Helping people make meaning out of their lives and facilitating psychological healing are her gifts.
